1.	Introduction
In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and shifting consumer preferences, the landscape of finance and credit has undergone a remarkable transformation. Today, we find ourselves at the crossroads of traditional financial practices and innovative financial technologies, with one such revolutionary concept being "Smart Credit: Buy Now Pay Later." This project delves into the historical context of credit systems worldwide, outlines the aims and objectives of establishing a reliable credit scoring system, and highlights the numerous benefits and advantages of maintaining a robust credit score.

2.	Problem Statement
In recent years, there has been a notable surge in unsecured lending models in the United States and several developed nations. Mackenzie has pinpointed the causes behind this growth, attributing it to the increasing number of applicants seeking these financial services, heightened borrower awareness and accessibility, and greater investments in emerging lending startups. Consequently, a more recent fintech lending model, known for providing loans at the point of sale, has surfaced within the lending industry since 2016. This development can be attributed to the emergence of startups like Affirm, Klarna, AfterPay, and PayPal Credit. Its rapid expansion can be linked to its integration into the online shopping process and the introduction of new business models (McKinsey, 2019).
The latest lending approach, known as POS lending, is focused on capturing the credit card market. By incorporating the financing department into online retail operations and seamlessly integrating it into the customer journey, spanning from research and exploration to the final payment stage, these loan offerings can significantly boost online businesses' conversion rates, often doubling or even tripling them, while also enhancing customer loyalty for both shoppers and online retailers.
Because loan applicants within these systems typically consist of individuals who have been unable to secure financing from traditional banks, the likelihood of loan default in fintech lending platforms tends to be higher compared to that of borrowers from banks (Calebe de Roure, Loriana Pelizzon, and Paolo Tasca, 2016). Consequently, the paramount challenge facing these platforms is the rigorous and highly accurate validation of applicants, enabling them to more effectively predict the probability of borrower default compared to conventional banks.

3.	Relevance and Significance
Creating a tool to assess a user's creditworthiness based on their previous spending habits, especially when they are new to Canada and have no credit history, can offer several advantages:
1.	Inclusion of Newcomers: Traditional credit scoring systems often require a credit history, which newcomers to Canada lack. This tool can help include a wider range of people in the financial system, making it easier for them to access credit and other financial services.
2.	Improved Accuracy: By analyzing a user's previous spending habits, this tool can provide a more accurate representation of their financial behavior and creditworthiness than a traditional credit score, which may not account for all relevant factors.
3.	Risk Assessment: Financial institutions can use this tool to better assess the risk associated with lending to individuals without a credit history. It can help identify individuals who may be responsible borrowers despite their lack of credit history.
4.	Responsible Lending: Lenders can make more informed lending decisions, potentially reducing the risk of default. This can lead to responsible lending practices and fewer defaults.
5.	Financial Inclusion: Enhancing access to credit for newcomers and those without a credit history promotes financial inclusion, allowing individuals to establish themselves financially and participate fully in the economy.
6.	Competitive Advantage: Financial institutions that adopt such tools can gain a competitive advantage by offering innovative solutions to attract and retain customers who may have been underserved in the past.
7.	Personalized Products: With a better understanding of a user's spending habits, financial institutions can offer personalized financial products and services that meet the specific needs of the individual.
8.	Reduced Dependence on Collateral: In the absence of a credit history, lenders often rely on collateral, which may not be accessible to everyone. This tool can reduce the reliance on collateral by assessing an individual's creditworthiness through their spending habits.
9.	Faster Decision-Making: Traditional credit assessments can be time-consuming and may involve paperwork. This tool can expedite the decision-making process, allowing lenders to make faster lending decisions.
10.	Data Security and Privacy: It's important to prioritize data security and user privacy when developing such a tool. Proper encryption and privacy measures can help build trust with users and regulators.
It's worth noting that while such a tool offers many advantages, it also presents challenges, such as data privacy concerns, data accuracy, and the need for regulatory compliance. Developing a robust and ethical tool that addresses these concerns is essential for its successful implementation.
